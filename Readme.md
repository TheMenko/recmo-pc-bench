# Polynomial Commitment Benchmark


## Machines

* `m1-max`: Apple M1 Max on a Macbook Pro 16" with 64GB memory.
* `hpc6a`: AWS EC2 `hpc6a.48xlarge` instance.
* `a14`: Apple iPhone 13 Pro with 6GB DDR and 512 GB NVMe.


## Algorithms

I'm aiming for settings that maximize prover performance. I am also not interested in zero-knowledge, as that can be achieved more efficiently in later layers of recursion.

* `blst`: Compute an MSM of scalars and BLS12-381 ùîæ‚ÇÅ points.
* `plonky2-keccak`: Compute a Keccak Merkle tree of a low degree expansion over Goldilocks. The rate is set to 2 and the FFT root table is pre-computed.
* `plonky2-poseidon`: Same, but using Goldilocks-Poseidon hash function.
* `halo2`: Compute the MSM of scalars and Pallas points.
* `pse`: Compute MSM of BN254 ùîæ‚ÇÅ points using PSE fork of Halo2.
* `gnark` Compute MSM of scalars and BN254 ùîæ‚ÇÅ points using the `kzg.Commit` function.

## Limits

BLST on m1-max can go up to 2^28 before running out of memory.
BLST on hpc6a can go up to 2^30 before running out of memory.
This is expected since the input data will fill the memory.

Plonky2 on m1-max can go to 2^28 before running out of memory.
Plonky2 on hpc6a can go to 2^30 before running out of memory.
This is surprising because the input data is far short of filling the memory.

Gnark on hpc6a can go to 2^30 before running out of memory.
